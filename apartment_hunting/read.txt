SOLUTION  APPROACH :: There are multiple possibility of answers to this questions  
                      Here we are basically establishing a trade-off between time and space complexity
                      Initialise all blocks to "data"  and we declare Index for outputing the minimun farthest distance
                      now  for every blocks it go through the every requirements and find the closest block that required
                      and change the Index  value  for that minimun of current value .AT the end it returns the index value with  the minimum farthest distance value
